    "In the bleak highland province of Machlearnia, four clans of\n",

    "make their homes. They are clans\n",
    "Carmichael, Mair, Matheson and Mcmullen\n",
    "and each is more bloodthirsty than the last. Their predilection for\n",
    "drunken brawling is exceeded only by a profound love of gambling,\n",
    "and it is by this narrow preference that an uneasy peace has held\n",
    "for nearly 40 years. Can it survive another?\n",
    "\n",
    "The highlight of every year is the Autumn Clanmoot, when the clans\n",
    "come together on neutral ground to feast, carouse, trade insults and\n",
    "wager vast sums on the arcane sport of Grachlangenball, in a tournament\n",
    "played over five days. The victorious clan are proclaimed\n",
    "Heroes of Machlearnia, entitled to wear pheasant feathers in their beards\n",
    "all winter. They almost never do this, because it looks ridiculous,\n",
    "but the prize is hotly contested all the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visitors flock to the moot from far beyond the borders of Machlearnia,\n",
    "for the boozing and spectacle, for the frisson of danger. There is money\n",
    "to be made and lost, merchandise to be bought and sold, and only a moderate\n",
    "risk of being run through with a sword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visitors like **you**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first Clanmoot. You are a stranger around here and you\n",
    "don't really know how everything works. But you've nosed around a bit and\n",
    "think you might be able to make your fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peoples of Machlearnia are characterised by ten frankly cryptic attributes:\n",
    "avoidance, chirp, curliness, entropy, furriness, gloom, meanness, moisture, vibe and wickedness.\n",
    "You know that a clan's performance in Grachlangenball is largely\n",
    "determined by these attributes, but you don't know how — and the\n",
    "clansfolk aren't telling.\n",
    "In the run-up to this year's Clanmoot you have cunningly obtained\n",
    "the stats on all the participants, but you don't know who is who.\n",
    "However, you have also acquired more complete information from last\n",
    "year's tournament, so hopefully that will give you some clues."
